Anonymous posts by ip?  hmm...
Store server/client commit hashes on events?
Event hash instead of handle?  Might prevent intentional collisions


Seems like you should be able to just post events, like if you're another server pushing data (maybe not allowed?), or if you're a user that keeps their own private key.
  In order for this to work, it might be necessary for an "error: missing events with handles [X,Y,Z]" return message to exist
